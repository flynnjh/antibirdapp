The goal of this project is to make a Twitter client with React Native. This client will intentionally add friction to the Twitter experience. For example, tweets will only be shown once unless saved to the timeline by the user. Hopefully, this will essentially make doomscrolling impossible.

TODO:

- Complete Profile View ‚úÖ
- Complete Tweets View
- Complete Timeline
- Add search bar to set the username
- Switch to a UI Library like React Native Paper ‚Äî making my own styles is a pain (learnt a lot though lol).
